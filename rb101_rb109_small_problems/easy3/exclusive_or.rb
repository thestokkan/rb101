#
# Exclusive Or
#
# The || operator returns a truthy value if either or both of its operands are
# truthy. If both operands are falsey, it returns a falsey value. The && operator
# returns a truthy value if both of its operands are truthy, and a falsey value if
# either operand is falsey. This works great until you need only one of two
# conditions to be truthy, the so-called exclusive or.
#
# In this exercise, you will write a function named xor that takes two arguments,
# and returns true if exactly one of its arguments is truthy, false otherwise.
# Note that we are looking for a boolean result instead of a truthy/falsy value as
# returned by || and &&.


def xor?(value1, value2)
  (value1 || value2) && !(value1 && value2)
end



# Test cases:

puts xor?(5.even?, 4.even?) == true
puts xor?(5.odd?, 4.odd?) == true
puts xor?(5.odd?, 4.even?) == false
puts xor?(5.even?, 4.odd?) == false
